# Fat BOTtomed Girls (FBG) - 2025 Eurobot Project

## Overview

**[Eurobot](https://www.eurobot.org/eurobot-contest/)** is an international robotics competition created in France.
The main goal of this event is to encourage youth to practice robotics with fun, by offering them an unforgettable technical and human experience.
Each year, a new theme is defined and the rules are adapted accordingly, with original actions to perform and a **100% self-made robot to build**.
Robots have to be **autonomous** and must be able to perform various tasks on a playing field in a limited amount of time to gather points.
Aside from the main robot, teams can build SIMAs (Small Independent Mobile Actuator), which are small autonomous robots only living during the last 15 seconds of the match.
Project management, task sharing, autonomy, team spirit and experimentation are the core values to achieve one’s project and be ready to compete on the D-Day.

The 2025 theme is **The Show Must Go On!**:

> This year the robots want to do even more competitions, more matches for more fun, but this comes with a cost.
> And in order to raise the necessary funds, some big charity concerts are planned: the Robot-Rock-Tour!
> But putting on a show is a lot of work and that’s why the robots are working extra hard to finish the preparations as quickly as possible, so that the show can take place on time.

## Project

The repository contains the code used for the SIMAs (Superstar & Groupies) in the [SIMA](./SIMA) folder and the code used for the main robot in the [BIG_BOT](./BIG_BOT) folder.

SIMAs were developed using simple `Arduino` components and coded in `C++`/`Arduino`.
The main robot was developed using a Raspberry Pi 4 to control most of the tasks, hardware, and robotic logic in `Python`.
